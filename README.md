# A machine learning project for Phishing Website Detection using classification algorithms like Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests and deploy it using flask

## A machine learning model can be trained on a dataset of real and fake websites. Once trained, it can analyze a new website and predict whether it is real or a phishing site based on various features like URL structure, domain age, or suspicious keywords.
# Project Breakdown:
## 1. Dataset Loading: Reads a phishing dataset (you need a CSV file with labeled phishing and legitimate websites).
## 2. Feature Engineering: Extracts important features related to domain, URL, page structure, and content.
## 3. Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and normalizes data.
## 4. Model Training: Uses Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Network classifiers.
## 5. Model Evaluation: Measures accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices for comparison.

# To test the trained phishing detection model using a URL, we need to extract relevant features from the given URL and pass them to the model for prediction.
#  Deploy the model using a Flask API to check URLs in real-time
